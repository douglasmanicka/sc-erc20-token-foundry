# Smart Contract ERC20 Token - Foundry Project

This is an study project of an ERC20 smart contract built with [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/). It was created for learning purposes, with a focus on clean architecture, automated testing, and smart contract security fundamentals.

---

## ðŸ“¦ Technologies used

- Solidity ^0.8.x
- Foundry (Forge + Cast)
- VSCode
- Git

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Create a simple and functional ERC20 token
- Write automated tests using Foundry
- Explore functions like `mint`, `transfer`, `approve`, and `transferFrom`
- Practice building a secure and auditable project structure

---

## ðŸš€ Running locally

> Prerequisites: [Foundry installed](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation)

````bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sc-erc20-token-foundry.git
cd sc-erc20-token-foundry

## More about Foundry

**Foundry is a blazing fast, portable and modular toolkit for Ethereum application development written in Rust.**

Foundry consists of:

-   **Forge**: Ethereum testing framework (like Truffle, Hardhat and DappTools).
-   **Cast**: Swiss army knife for interacting with EVM smart contracts, sending transactions and getting chain data.
-   **Anvil**: Local Ethereum node, akin to Ganache, Hardhat Network.
-   **Chisel**: Fast, utilitarian, and verbose solidity REPL.
